Paris appears to make a similar analysis .
The inquiry into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January discovered two bridges .
The men kidnapped men in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqui , Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory had to be killed on the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by special French forces .
Among the rubble left behind by the action , French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists .
Terrorist axis
The analysis of calls exchanged indicates several interlocutors based in Mali , in Niger and in Nigeria .
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers interest the investigators in particular; one leads to a Nigerian who lived for a long time in Maiduguri , a town in Northern Nigeria , the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man said to be close to Aqmi and to the sect .
&quot; This is an advance , but it is undoubtedly necessary to await more exact proofs before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram . &quot;
&quot; But it is possible . &quot;
&quot; It has been known for years that the sect benefits from outside financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active , says Kunle Amuwo , a Nigerian researcher .
In recent months , this support became more and more evident from the developments and statements by Boko Haram and from its methods of operation , which increasingly include resort to kamikazes and to increasingly complex explosive engines of the same type as those used by Aqmi .
The international community , starting with Washington , is now exerting pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems caused by Boko Haram .
Nigerian authorities have in fact long considered the group to be a community of enlightened persons not worthy of interest .
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 at Maiduguri around a mosque , a school and a fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf , Boko Haram - which means in Hausa &quot; with Western education &quot; is a criminal , who promotes the installation of an islamic emirate in the Moslem north of Nigeria .
In this poor region , the association is enjoying rapid success .
It is politicised and demands rigid respect of sharia , whilst its militants engage in a struggle with the impious central government .
The latter target primarily churches , bars and administrations .
In 2009 , the militants of Boko Haram showed themselves particularly active , multiplying attacks on police establishments .
The reaction of Abuja is , as usual , without light and shade .
The army surrounds a town and leaves 800 dead behind .
Mohammed Yusuf , arrested alive , was killed in prison .
Now the sect will become radicalised and will leave its northern fiefs .
Last Christmas it claimed an attack , which left 80 dead at Jos and then more at Abuja .
In June at Abuja , Boko Haram takes a secured police QG during a suicide attack , its first .
In August , the local United Nations headquarters will be its first international target .
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa , which will move from Mauritania to Somalia via Nigeria , now disquiets all security specialists .
Now that Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger and the Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya , Boko Haram appears to be a new menace in the continent .
Last week during an interview in Nigeria with president Goodluck Jonathan , Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and declared himself ready to share all intelligence .
The world according to the republican presidential candidates
Concerning China , Iran , aid to Israel , Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , and Rick Perry compete in simplification and a lack of knowledge .
Can an America weakened by crisis , lead a complex world by simple and indeed , simplistic , ideas ?
To listen to republican presidential candidates , the electors might believe it .
For some days , Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , Rick Perry and the others multiply resounding and abbreviated foreign policy declarations , which are traditionally a republican strong suit .
Concerning China , Iran and aid to Israel , the slogans , are often fused together .
Mitt Romney , the best placed for nomination of the &quot; Grand Old Party , &quot; threatened to drag the Chinese before the OMC and to accuse them of &quot; manipulation of their currency , a sensitive subject in an America exasperated by the migration of whole sections of its industry to Asia .
So much the worse if this should trigger a trade war , he said .
Jon Huntsman , Obama &apos;s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a vision of a sophisticated foreign policy , has failed to suppress an attitude which flatters the emotions .
He called for a muscular , but a constructive , dialogue with Peking (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman , who is stagnating at the bottom of the polls , remains inaudible .
In the style of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran , if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme .
&quot; If I am elected , I will stop Iran , he trumpeted . &quot;
&quot; If Obama is re-elected , they will have the bomb . &quot;
Hr also promised to increase military aid to Israel , accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to wards that partner .
The entrepreneur Herman Cain , the second best-placed candidate , declares an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files .
Recently , he called for opposition to the Chinese military threat , because Peking is trying to develop a nuclear capacity - apparently unaware of the fact that China has possessed it since 1964 !
The Texas governor Rick Perry , who supports Israel and wants military strikes against Iran , says that he is ready to involve the USA army in Mexico against the drug cartels .
Resort to the torture of terrorist suspects prohibited by Obama in 2009 , is also recommended by Cain , Perry and by the candidate Michele Bachmann .
One is far away from the 2008 republican candidate John McCain , a foreign policy heavyweight .
The opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war .
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to water down his wine concerning anti-terrorism .
They insist with good reason on the setback of his naive dialogue with Iran on the premature departure of the &quot; boys &quot; from Iraq , his tergiversations in Libya labelling him weak .
But the attack is not so easy .
The population judges as positive Obama &apos;s the balance of national security , which eliminated Bin Laden .
Since Iraq , it distrusts military interventions , which run into quicksands .
And in arguing that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically to revive its leadership , Obama is right .
The North Stream , a new portal for the entry of Russian gas into Europe
The North Stream gasduct connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the bottom of the Baltic sea , has been commissioned .
It is scheduled to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes .
Gazprom , the giant Russian gas producer , wanted to celebrate the event with a &quot; bang . &quot;
Over 500 guests including four heads of State and of government took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic , between an orchestral performance and a fine buffet , in the inauguration of North Stream , the new gasduct , which directly links Russia and Germany under the sea .
Symbolically , the German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev , the French prime minister François Fillon and his Dutch opposite number Mark Rutte jointly turned the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network .
With this new gasduct , 27,5 thousand million additional cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe via a first pipeline of 1 224 km linking the region of Saint Petersburg to the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania .
A second pipeline is due to be ready by the end of 2012 , making it possible to deliver a total of 55 thousand million cubic metres of gas , the equivalent of the entire French consumption .
And the possibility of constructing a third pipeline of the same course is already under discussion .
For Gazprom , the completion on time of this huge project is a victory .
The project was fiercely competed for by Poland and the Baltic States .
The North Stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany , avoiding any passage via a third country (Poland or the Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close access to West European markets .
At the most critical point of the debate , Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream new &quot; German-Soviet pact , &quot; referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939 .
That is to say that the topic is politically sensitive .
By supporting this Russian project , Western Europe is gaining greater security for its supplies .
But at the price of depriving Europe of energy , since the project has created a breach between eastern and western Europe .
Russia has succeeded in less than five years , in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the the rich Western countries , which consume large quantities of gas , and whose deposits are declining .
&quot; This gasduct is a component of partnership with Russia , it is a new artery which links us organically , &quot; confirmed François Fillon inaugurating the gasduct , demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important .
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom , present in large numbers at Lubmin , the point of arrival of the gas .
The construction of this gasduct is also a technical exploit .
The undersea pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete , in order to protect it from ships &apos; anchors .
Ir rests on the bottom of the sea , at an average depth of 200 metres .
To construct it , it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the second World War .
&quot; A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution , &quot; says Jens Müller , spokesman of North Stream company .
It was also necessary to multiply steps of protecting the fauna and the flora .
The pipeline is a long metal serpent , of weight equivalent to that of 242 Eiffel towers , with no breaks throughout its length , no valves and no maintenance stations .
A control platform was provided on the level of Sweden , but the project managers abandoned it since the Swedes were not keen on seeing a Russian State company becoming permanently on its shores .
&quot; In case of accident we stop the passage of gas for at least one minute , &quot; states Jens Müller .
In the case of a leak , the gas contained in the gasduct therefore escapes into the air .
But this is thought to be unlikely by the constructors who provided welds to leak only every 100 000 years .
The surveillance of the state of the gasduct is provided by an undersea robot , pulled by a ship for outside observation , as well as by an apparatus circulating within the gasduct .
Being cigar-shaped , it is introduced inside the 1-metre wide pipeline , and it is pushed along by the gas .
On arrival after 3 complete days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second , it delivers precise information concerning any metal deformation .
The gasduct was designed to work for 50 years without any need for even the smallest repair .
The gas circulation is implemented simply by its pressure .
This is 200 bar on leaving and 100 bar on arrival .
Five companies combined their forces to implement this project .
The leader remains Gazprom , which holds 51% of the shareholding .
The others are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and the Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint enterprise called North Stream , delegated to construct and to operate the gasduct .
It has its headquarters at Zug in Switzerland , where taxation is particularly favourable .
Gazprom next leased to this company for twenty renewable years , the entire capacity of gas transport .
&quot; Gazprom will pay for the total capacity , whatever may be the quantity of gas actually transported , &quot; states Jens Müller .
The financing of the construction of the gasduct was provided to the extent of 30% by the shareholders and of 70% by Bank loans .
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand million Euros for the two pipelines .
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 millions .
But the minority shareholders are certain to recover their costs , since Gazprom assumes the entire risk .
The gasduct emerges from the Baltic sea at Lubmin on a sandy littoral planted with conifers .
4.5 metre high valves form the gas exit .
Sensors measure pressure , temperature and the specific gravities of arriving gas before being transferred into German gasducts .
Since last Tuesday , the terminal has been receiving one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour .
At full capacity , this will be 3 million an hour and in 2012 , 6 million .
Moleskine , a brand card .
Created fifteen years ago by an Italian company , Moleskine will restore the taste of writing .
It is a scent of adventure , of hours sent in writing by a the light of a candle .
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognised , by its black rectangular cover , its elastic , its broken white pages , as if aged over time .
Nevertheless , the Moleskine notebook as we know it today , was born in 1997 .
The Italian company Modo Modo , based in Milan , decided to launch a designer notebook .
Maria Sebregondi , then a consultant of the company , has assumed responsibility for the launch of the new product .
The notebook draws its inspiration from an old production technique , the mole skin which means varnished cotton used for covering benches , for example .
This type of notebook is said to be highly prized by writers and travellers .
&quot; Moleskine has been updated to meet current taste for an old and forgotten object , which was an avantgarde artists &apos; icon up to the XXth century , &quot; related Maria Sebregondi , who has since become the manager of the brand name at Modo Modo .
Success is there .
Between 2006 and 2010 , sales rose by 25% to reach 12.7 million units .
One has travelled far from the production of the first years , when only 3000 notebooks were made .
Moleskine is crossing the Italian frontiers and is exporting to 70 countries , from France to the USA .
It is difficult to establish a profile of the typical purchaser , because the notebook attracts equally a businessman , a student and a professional .
Moleskine consumers are cosmopolitan , open-minded and cultivated .
The small Italian company , which had only 12 employees at the start , now has almost 100 and two offices , one in Milan and the other in New York .
Its distributes its notebooks to Fnac libraries , small shops in town centres and has succeeded in becoming well known .
&quot; We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new means of writing , notwithstanding the rise of e-mail , &quot; explains Maria Sebregondi .
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine; recently , the brand launched an exhibition &quot; Detour &quot; where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook .
In August , it also launched a leopardskin pattern cover on the occasion of the Film Festival in Locarno .
Exploiting its success and the cultural aura , Moleskine diversified its products to include handbags , pens , computer bags . The brand includes every kind of support .
A success , which aroused envy; in the autumn of 2006 , Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe , now Syntegra Capital , to write a new page in the history of Moleskine .
Why is the rate of unemployment of handicapped workers so high ?
Some 19% of handicapped persons are looking for work .
The 15th week for the employment of the handicapped starts today .
Despite a public voluntary policy introduced in 2005 , the rate of unemployment of the handicapped is still twice as high as the average , namely 19% , versus 9% for the population as a whole .
Discouraging ?
&quot; No , stresses Eric Blanchet , Director-General of Adapt , the association which organises the week for the employment of the handicapped . &quot;
&quot; The progress achieved since 15 years ago is considerable . &quot;
&quot; At that time the rate of unemployment was not 2x but 3x as high . &quot;
&quot; There is however still a huge amount to do . &quot;
It must be said that for the handicapped , the obstacles to obtaining employment are still many .
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They have rather a low level of qualifications; 80% do not have the &quot; bac &quot; and out of the 2.3 million students in higher education only 10 000 are handicapped .
Lastly , long-term unemployment is very widespread , being 85% for the handicapped versus 38% on an average .
Briefly , all these are criteria which greatly complicate a return to employment and which constitute the nub of the problem , &quot; according to Christian Grapin , director-general of Tremplin , an association created in 1992 to help companies to recruit handicapped workers .
Here are some of the brakes .
It is hardly necessary to speak about mentalities , which do change , but too slowly .
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité showed that the managers questioned had a low level of knowledge of handicap , &quot; with an &quot; over-representation of persons in wheelchairs , psychically or intellectually deficient persons . &quot;
Result - private companies employing over 20 persons are still far from achieving the objective of employing the 6% of handicapped workers , fixed by a law dating back to 1987 .
The latter known figures dating to 2008 have a ratio of 2.6% .
&quot; We are now on around 3% , &quot; says Pierre Blanc , director-general of the Agefiph , the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies which do not observe this law .
Proof: The number of &quot; taxed &quot; establishments , like the sums paid , have fallen between 2007 and 2011 , from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million Euros).
&quot; The law of 2005 , which raised the contributions , created a strong pressure on companies , explains Pierre Blanc . &quot;
&quot; But this improvement also reflects a rise of consciousness , in particular within large groups . &quot;
According to the ministry of employment , only 59% of establishments employing between 20 and 49 handicapped persons , versus 82% of companies employing between 100 and 199 persons .
Chance: &quot; What happiness &quot;
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday evening (20.45 hrs) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure , which this friendly match gave to them .
We do not go so far as to say that there was connivance between them , but the image is symbolic .
Sitting side by side on the tribune of the auditorium of the Stade de France , Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace .
Five months following the gesture of humour of his attacker against Turkey , the Belgian selector can only be praised .
&quot; I am very pleased with Eden , his progress and the fact that he is Belgian . &quot;
&quot; I want to go forward , assures the Lillois .
In contrast between his respective club and selection performances , &quot; it is of a piece if it is justified . &quot;
&quot; At Lille , I am there all the year round , which is not the case of Belgium . &quot;
&quot; I must take my marks . &quot;
Selected to play against Romania on Friday evening in its match against France , Hazard went to Saint-Denis in order at last to &quot; shine . &quot;
Not however forgetting the notion of &quot; pleasing . &quot;
He encouraged the Blues from the age of 7 years and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000 .
&quot; I always supported them , he affirms .
This necessarily participates in strengthening even more the particular character of this match .
All the more so , since opposite are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), &quot; he recalls .
&quot; We just crossed each others path . &quot;
&quot; To be able to play against them , that is pure happiness ! &quot;
With bonhomie , Leekens recalled &quot; pride . &quot;
&quot; Pride &quot; of playing in &quot; a gala match . &quot;
&quot; Pride &quot; also in inding ass &quot; neighbour &quot; that France has &quot; become again a very high level team &quot; only a little more than one year after the trauma of Knysna .
&quot; Laurent Blanc was a thunderbolt , he enthuses .
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro , the technician will share an aircraft with the Blues management ... Brazil in 2014 .
&quot; Our little Belgians become big , &quot; he stressed .
&quot; One is building something , the players are ambitious , they are hungry . &quot;
&quot; You will realise this during the matches to come . Including that against France .
Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento starts its return match against Bosnia (22h00) very optimistically , this Tuesday in Lisbon .
On their way there , both teams appeared to lack realism .
&quot; At the end of these 90 minutes , we will be a happy team and most importantly , a happy country . &quot;
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and in the Ukraine .
For him there is not a shadow of a doubt , the Selection , with which he has been at odds since September 2010 , will qualify for Euro 2012 .
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness .
But there is match to play and an opponent , Bosnia to conquer .
In view of the (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica it is clear that the games are not over .
Whilst Portugal dominated the match for over one hour , it was not able to reach this precious target , which would have consoled it .
&quot; It is a good result , which nevertheless involves a certain risk &quot;
But on their side , in their illuminated Stade de la Luz in Lisbon , the Portuguese are convinced that they are playing in front of a public which must be enthusiastic , even if the match is very close , &quot; said an optimistic , but lucid , Bento
&quot; We are expecting a very close match , but we are convinced that we can win , declared the Portuguese trainer aged 42 .
&quot; We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012 , &quot; even under the successor of Carlos Queiroz .
The zero taken on Friday from Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to win .
A zero may be sufficient for the Bosnians .
&quot; It is a good result , which nevertheless carries some risk , regrets Bento .
